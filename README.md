# Machine-Learning-Model---Car-Price-predictor
Purpose - 
The intention behind building this model is to solve a real world problem. An automobile company from a different nation is wanting to enter a foreign market. They want to price their vehicles properly &amp; this model tries to serve that purpose. Amongst all the available variables, the ones that contribute most to the pricing of a car are selected & in the end the logic behind selecting those as part of the linear model is explained.

Approach - 
After doing thorough data cleaning, outlier treatment& EDA, for the model's variable selection,I have used stepwise selection approach

Objective -
The machine learning model will try to predict the prices of cars based on the variables available at it's disposal. 

Dataset -
The dataset used to create the model will be attached herein. 

Other Files - 
There will be a well commented R file trying to explain the logic behind
each step. 

Results - 
The result set received is pretty good. about 92.5% of the test dataset's car prices were predicted with a variance tolerance of 85.5%.
